DESIGN SETTING PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS
Penicillin allergies are not always lifelong Approximately 50% are lost over five years
A reaction to penicillin during a childhood infection is unlikely to be a true allergy
Only 1–2% of patients with a confirmed penicillin allergy have an allergy to cephalosporins In patients with a low risk of severe allergic reactions cephalosporins are a relatively safe treatment option
Patients with a history of delayed non-severe reactions such as mild childhood rashes that occurred over 10 years ago may be suitable for an oral rechallenge with low-dose penicillin This should be done in a supervised hospital environment
In many cases with appropriate assessment and allergy testing it may be possible to remove the penicillin allergy label

CASE INTRODUCTION AND RESPONSE
METHODS & PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
RESEARCH SUMMARY
Most antibiotic use in Australia arises from prescriptions in the community
The risk of antibiotic-related adverse events including resistance increases with longer treatment courses
When antibiotics are indicated for treatment short courses are as effective as standard ones for most common infections
Therapeutic Guidelines Antibiotic is a key reference for antimicrobial prescribing in Australia
General practitioners play a key role in reducing antibiotic use
Uncomplicated urinary tract infection is one of the most common indications for antibiotic use in the community However the Gram-negative organisms that can cause the infection are becoming more resistant to antibiotics
Many multidrug resistant organisms retain susceptibility to two old antibiotics nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin Advantages over newer drugs include their high urinary concentrations and minimal toxicity
Fosfomycin is a potential treatment option for patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection due to resistant organisms Nitrofurantoin may be more effective and can be used for urinary infections in pregnant women

TRIAL REGISTER DATE
The human gut contains many species of microorganisms many of which have a role in maintaining good health The gut microbiota can be affected by diet diseases and drugs especially antibiotics
Faecal microbiota transplantation involves transplanting faecal material from a healthy person to a patient with the aim of treating disease It is a recommended treatment option for patients with recurrent or refractory Clostridioides difficile as it has a cure rate over 90%
There is evidence that faecal microbiota transplantation can induce remission in ulcerative colitis however maintenance of remission data are lacking For other diseases it currently should not be used outside a clinical trial
Stool donors have to be healthy and are screened for a range of diseases As faecal material is usually transplanted during colonoscopy the recipient must have bowel preparation before the procedure
Adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal and usually resolve in the week following transplantation There are limited data on long-term safety

THE CURRENT SITUATION
HISTORICAL ASPECTS
High blood pressure is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events A cardiovascular risk-based approach is best for determining when to start antihypertensive treatment
Recent trial evidence has suggested lower blood pressure targets are beneficial This has influenced international guidelines The US guidelines have a lower threshold for defining hypertension than current Australian and European guidelines
The patient’s individual circumstances must be considered when treatment targets are set For someone with a high risk of cardiovascular events a systolic blood pressure target of 120 mmHg may be appropriate

REPORT CASE
THE PROTOCOL REGISTRATION
ORGANISMS
POLICY
Atrial fibrillation carries a markedly increased risk of stroke and left ventricular dysfunction and is associated with reduced quality of life
In light of the potential for poor outcomes and the likely understated presence of silent atrial fibrillation opportunistic screening should be carried out in general practice
Modifying the risk factors for atrial fibrillation is the cornerstone of management with adjuvant drug therapy to help maintain sinus rhythm control the ventricular rate and reduce the risk of cerebral thromboembolism
The need for anticoagulant therapy can be assessed by using the revised CHA2DS2-VASc score Direct oral anticoagulants are now preferred to warfarin in those who qualify for their use
Catheter ablation is an effective option to improve survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction It also improves quality of life and reduces arrhythmia-related hospital admissions

TREATMENT PLAN AND PROGRESS
RATIONAL & OBJECTIVE
Penicillins are commonly prescribed to children Recommendations in the product information may not be the most appropriate doses for children and may list clinical indications that are preferably treated with other antibiotics
Reputable guidelines for example Therapeutic Guidelines Antibiotic offer up-to-date advice on optimal choice route dosage and duration of oral penicillins in children
In most instances the child’s weight should be used to calculate the dose in mg per kg without exceeding the maximum adult dose
When prescribing higher weight-based doses of amoxicillin or flucloxacillin check the volume of oral liquid required to complete a treatment course to ensure adequate supply
Systemic lupus erythematosus should be suspected in individuals with one or more classic symptoms Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by serology
Reducing sun exposure is central to the management of lupus
Hydroxychloroquine is first-line treatment unless contraindicated and is useful in almost all manifestations of lupus Other treatments are titrated against type and severity of organ involvement
Monoclonal antibodies have a limited role in the management of lupus
Lithium is one of the most effective mood stabilisers for people with a mood disorder However many of these patients are also taking other medicines that could potentially interact with lithium
To minimise the risk of relapse it is usually necessary to maintain the lithium serum concentration between 06 mmol/L and 08 mmol/L
Lithium clearance is easily influenced by drugs that alter renal function such as ACE inhibitors angiotensin receptor antagonists diuretics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
It is therefore prudent for prescribers to monitor and adjust the lithium dose to avoid adverse effects or loss of efficacy

MAIN DISCUSSION
Patients sometimes present to a medical practitioner with dental pain if they cannot see a dentist
Doctors need to be aware of the common dental diseases that result in pain so they can help to manage the patient’s symptoms until they are able to see a dentist
Appropriate advice regarding analgesics for dental pain is important Paracetamol and ibuprofen are more effective in combination than either of them alone with or without opioids
Antibiotics are only indicated as an adjunct to dental treatment when there are signs of systemic involvement progressive and rapid spread of infection or when the patient is immunocompromised
Intravenous antibiotics are overused in hospitals Many infections can be managed with oral antibiotics
Oral antibiotics avoid the adverse effects of intravenous administration They are also usually less expensive
When intravenous antibiotics are indicated it may be possible to switch to oral therapy after a short course There are guidelines to aid the clinician with the timing of the switch so that there is no loss of efficacy
Infections that may be suitable for a short course of intravenous antibiotic include pneumonia complicated urinary tract infections certain intra-abdominal infections Gram-negative bacteraemia acute exacerbations of chronic lung disease and skin and soft tissue infections
Bone and joint infections and infective endocarditis are managed with prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics However there is research looking at the feasibility of an earlier switch to oral antibiotics in these conditions
Renal supportive care incorporates the principles of palliative care into the management of patients with advanced kidney disease Its focus is on improving the quality of life for patients with a high burden of symptoms
Common problems include pain restless legs syndrome and uraemic pruritus Symptom management must involve patient participation education and non-pharmacological strategies to address both physical and psychosocial problems and to prioritise patient-centred goals
The patients are medically complex and polypharmacy is common When prescribing it is important to consider the altered pharmacokinetics potential drug interactions and the clearance of drugs by dialysis
Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms with many possible causes including the adverse effects of drugs If a drug is indicated the cause guides the choice of antiemetic drug
The main antiemetic classes include antagonists of the serotonin dopamine histamine muscarinic and neurokinin systems corticosteroids and benzodiazepines Some antiemetics appear more effective for specific indications
Serotonin and neurokinin antagonists such as ondansetron and aprepitant are highly effective in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting Metoclopramide and antihistamines are first-line options for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy
Serotonin antagonists and some dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide can prolong the QT interval on the ECG Dopamine antagonists can cause extrapyramidal adverse effects particularly in children

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: We studied tonsils of 25 children aged 5-12 years with hypertrophy of palatine tonsils (HPT) and with chronic tonsillitis (CT). The content of α and γ – interferons, interleukins 1β, 4, 10, IgA, IgG in tonsil extract was determined by immunofluorescence assay. Immune complexes were determined using sedimentary test (3.75% solution of polyethylene glycol).

CONCLUSION (AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE)
STUDY SELECTION/METHODS
Acute herpes zoster and associated postherpetic neuralgia is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus It can be debilitating for older adults and interfere with activities of daily living
A live attenuated single-dose vaccine that protects against both acute herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is available for free to all Australians aged 70 years and in a catch-up program for those aged 71–79 years
The vaccine is contraindicated in people who are immunocompromised but can be considered in those who are receiving low doses of selected disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
Records of the Australian Immunisation Register suggest that only a third of 70 year olds received the vaccine in the first year-and-a-half of the program This is likely an underestimation but emphasises the importance of ensuring the vaccine is offered to all eligible patients and that vaccination is recorded on the Register
A non-live recombinant herpes zoster vaccine has recently been developed which is more efficacious than the live vaccine in clinical trials It is registered in Australia but not currently available
Approximately 20% of patients with obstructive lung disease have features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
These patients have a higher burden of disease and increased exacerbations compared to those with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alone
Management should address dominant clinical features in each individual patient and comorbidities should be considered
There are several interventions that are useful in the management of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
As inhaled corticosteroids are key to the management of asthma they are recommended in patients with overlapping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a highly heterogenous disease There is emerging evidence that treatment should be tailored to the individual’s associated comorbidities
No current algorithms exist for the management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Conventional therapies used in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are yet to show a mortality benefit
Key treatment objectives include control of hypertension and fluid balance
Common comorbidities include coronary artery disease atrial fibrillation obesity diabetes renal impairment and pulmonary hypertension These comorbidities should be considered in all patients and treatment optimised
Drug interactions can lead to significant toxicity or loss of clinical effect The risks increase with the number of drugs the patient takes
General and specialised drug interaction resources are available Access to up-to-date electronic resources is encouraged
There are gaps in the information on interactions for new drugs those with complicated metabolism and drugs with limited use It may be necessary to use multiple resources to find the information
When assessing information about interactions clinicians should evaluate the relevance for each patient In high-risk situations expert advice can be valuable
Clinicians should report new or unusual drug interactions to the Therapeutic Goods Administration
Australia’s National Medicines Policy was launched 20 years ago with the aim of improving health outcomes for all Australians It was developed in partnership with healthcare professionals consumers and the pharmaceutical industry
The key parts of the Policy focus on timely access to high-quality and affordable medicines and their safe and judicious use It also supports a viable and responsible pharmaceutical industry
Since the Policy was first launched Australia has seen significant changes in healthcare systems medicines subsidies health services remuneration digital technologies and the pharmaceutical industry
Medicines themselves have also changed as have consumers’ expectations To respond to these changes the National Medicines Policy needs to be updated with a greater focus on implementing and measuring outcomes

RESULTS EXAMINATION
Any drug or substance with effects on the central nervous system can impair the ability to drive safely
When prescribing consider the effects of each drug on driving as well as the use of other substances Advise the patient of the risks
Opioids benzodiazepines anticonvulsants antipsychotics and sedating antidepressants increase the risk of crashing Erratic use of sedatives causes a higher level of impairment than stable regimens
Patients who have complex medical conditions and take multiple drugs should undergo a fitness-to-drive assessment
The annual Aged Care National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey aims to identify local and national prescribing issues and guide antimicrobial stewardship goals
In the 2018 point prevalence survey medication charts of over 20000 residents were reviewed from 407 participating facilities across Australia
On the day of the survey almost 10% of residents were prescribed an antimicrobial
Nearly two-thirds of recently prescribed antimicrobials were for residents who had no documented signs or symptoms of infection
Over a quarter of antimicrobials had been prescribed for longer than six months
Incomplete documentation was a prominent barrier to proper review of antimicrobial therapy with the indication review date or stop date not documented for many prescriptions
Recommendations include using appropriate microbiological testing to guide prescribing following national antimicrobial prescribing guidelines documenting the indication for the antimicrobial and its start stop and review dates and monitoring and re-evaluating long-term antimicrobial use

Ethics and discussion
Drugs excreted by the kidney require dose reduction in chronic kidney disease This adjustment depends on the severity of the disease and what proportion of the drug is eliminated by the kidneys
The estimated glomerular filtration rate can generally be used to guide dose adjustment in patients with stable kidney function However the formula can be misleading in some patient subsets and other approaches are required
At extremes of body mass the estimated glomerular filtration rate can under- or overestimate kidney function It may need to be adjusted for body surface area particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentration to be effective Close monitoring of drug effect and toxicity is also needed and can be supported by therapeutic drug monitoring
For short courses of drugs with a wide therapeutic index dose adjustment may not be needed
Alternative methods for quantifying kidney function include the Cockcroft-Gault formula estimates creatinine clearance or direct measures of glomerular filtration rate using exogenous isotope compounds These are not commonly required

METHOLOGY
The implementation of computerised prescribing can result in large reductions in prescribing error rates The flow-on effects to patient outcomes are not well studied
The reduction in errors is dependent on prescribers becoming proficient in using the electronic prescribing system All potential safety benefits are therefore not expected to be achieved immediately
Electronic prescribing systems introduce new types of errors most frequently errors in selection Some of these errors can be prevented if the system is well designed
Computerised decision support embedded in electronic prescribing systems has enormous potential to improve medication safety However current support systems have a limited capacity to provide context-relevant advice to prescribers

METHODS/ ANALYSIS
Glycosylation is a crucial posttranslational modification that is involved in numerous biological events. Therefore, abnormal glycosylation can impair the functions of glycoproteins or glycolipids and is occasionally associated with cell dysfunction and human diseases. For example, aberrant glycosylation of dystroglycan (DG), a cellular receptor for matrix and synaptic proteins, is associated with muscular dystrophy and lissencephaly. DG sugar chains are required for high-affinity binding to ligand proteins, and thus disruption of DG-ligand linkages underlies disease conditions. Although their biological significance is well recognized, the sugar-chain structure of DG and its modification enzymes have long remained incompletely elucidated. However, recent seminal studies have finally revealed a highly regulated mechanism for DG glycosylation and have discovered a posttranslational unit, ribitol-phosphate, that was not previously known to be used in mammals. This review article introduces the structure, modification enzymes and functions of the sugar chains of DG, and then discusses their relationship to human diseases and therapeutic strategies

Clinical and scientific relevance
In type 2 diabetes diet exercise and attaining a healthy weight should be encouraged at every opportunity
Metformin is the usual first-line drug management
Sulfonylureas are appropriate as second-line drugs for many patients Other oral drugs are preferable if weight gain or hypoglycaemia are significant problems
If a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea is not suitable either a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor can be prescribed The patient characteristics and the beneficial and adverse effects of the drug should be considered when selecting second-line therapy
Due to their adverse-effect profiles thiazolidinediones and acarbose should be reserved for patients with contraindications to all other oral drugs and those who will not tolerate injectable drugs
Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that presents with abdominal pain related to defecation accompanied by a change in stool frequency or form Despite its impact on a patient’s quality of life it has no effect on mortality
A positive clinical diagnosis should be made if the characteristic symptoms are present and red flags are absent Red flags should prompt specialist referral
Consultations should be provided in an empathetic manner addressing the concerns of the patient while providing reassurance
Manipulating diet with the assistance of a dietitian is an appropriate initial treatment for irritable bowel syndrome A low-FODMAP diet is an effective therapy
Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common condition It can cause problems with urine storage and voiding and the severity of symptoms may be unrelated to the size of the prostate
When drug treatment is required benign prostatic hyperplasia can be managed with monotherapy or combination therapy Most patients are managed with selective alpha blockers
Patients with larger prostate volumes may benefit from a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor usually in combination with an alpha blocker
Androgen deprivation therapy has an important role in the medical treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer
The treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is influenced by whether the patient’s disease has progressed on androgen deprivation therapy or not It is considered to be castrate-resistant disease if the cancer has progressed despite adequate suppression of androgens
Chemotherapy using docetaxel or cabazitaxel and anti-androgen drugs such as abiraterone and enzalutamide can be used to treat castrate-resistant disease Radium-223 is an option for patients with bony metastases
Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is now considered a chronic illness as the life expectancy of patients has almost doubled due to the new treatments General practitioners are therefore more likely to encounter patients with disease- and treatment-related complications
Dry eye disease affects one in five adults and can significantly impair quality of life Most patients have mild disease
This condition is multifactorial with an inflammatory component which can markedly worsen the impact on the ocular surface Meibomian gland dysfunction is extremely common in dry eye disease and contributes to the inflammatory process
Management of mild disease includes identifying and removing precipitants and symptomatic treatment with artificial tear supplements
More advanced disease requires management of underlying ophthalmic and systemic conditions as well as more aggressive therapies to protect the ocular surface

CONCLUSIONConclusion: Uncontrolled use of technology with no input from health professionals, social media, and internet access with unreliable sources has more negative than positive effect. There is need for more research on how to successfully educate patients since technology is quickly expanding, and it is easier than ever to access to information online. Traditional education relying on authority is not currently successful.

Conclusion/Relevance
WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY
With greater awareness and social acceptance increasing numbers of transgender individuals are presenting for gender-affirming hormone treatment There should be a full psychosocial assessment by an experienced clinician before hormone treatment is considered
People assigned as males at birth who transition to female gender are transgender females Their management includes an estrogen plus an anti-androgen
People assigned as females at birth who transition to male gender are transgender males Their hormone treatment is testosterone
Treatment is titrated so that hormone concentrations are equivalent to the physiological concentrations of the preferred gender This aims to minimise adverse effects
The process of prescribing changes as children move into adulthood For some medicines such as psychotropic drugs safety and efficacy are less well understood in adolescents
As adolescents mature they attain the capacity to consent to their own medical treatment An assessment of their competency will need to take into account the nature of the treatment being proposed
Parental involvement is usually beneficial particularly for adolescents with chronic or complex conditions but increasing adolescent autonomy needs to be respected
Adherence to treatment can be supported by understanding adolescent development and involving adolescents in management plans
Drugs can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis which can result in a rise in core temperature This type of hyperthermia is unresponsive to antipyretics and can be complicated by rhabdomyolysis multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation
Organic causes of fever such as infection must be ruled out Syndromes associated with drug-induced fever include neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic sympathomimetic and serotonin toxicity
The class of offending drugs as well as the temporal relationship to starting or stopping them assists in differentiating between neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin toxicity
Immediate inpatient management is needed The mainstay of management is stopping the drug and supportive care often in the intensive care unit

Review of the literature
Quadrivalent influenza vaccination is recommended annually for adults and children aged six months to 64 years
High-dose or adjuvanted trivalent vaccines are recommended annually for people 65 years and over
If started early enough neuraminidase inhibitors reduce symptom duration by approximately one day Treatment should be considered in patients with severe disease requiring hospitalisation or who are at risk of complications
Chemoprophylaxis is not a substitute for vaccination but can be considered in high-risk individuals with an inadequate or ineffective vaccination status
Many therapeutic and illicit drugs can cause movement disorders Antipsychotics and antiemetics are most commonly implicated
The time of onset of the movement disorder may be acute subacute or chronic The severity can range from mild to severe and life-threatening
Early recognition of a drug-induced movement disorder is essential to allow for prompt intervention This includes stopping the offending drug supportive care and sometimes other pharmacological treatment
Immune checkpoints normally stop the body from mounting an immune response against healthy cells Some cancers can acquire these checkpoints so that the tumour cells are not recognised by the immune system
Inhibiting the checkpoints therefore enables the tumour cells to be recognised and allows an immune response to be activated against them
Immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve the survival of some patients with advanced malignancies These include malignant melanoma renal cell carcinoma urothelial bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer
Trials have shown that immune checkpoint inhibitors have significant benefits over conventional therapies so they are increasingly being used in routine clinical practice
However a significant proportion of patients will not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors and retain a poor prognosis The optimal use of these drugs requires further study
Immune-related adverse events commonly include pneumonitis hepatitis nephritis colitis and endocrinopathies However nearly any organ system can be affected These toxicities present clinicians with a new challenge of recognising them early and acting promptly

REVIEW OF CURRENT PRACTICE
Context and Background
Adherence to drug regimens is critical to optimise therapeutic outcomes To aid adherence patient preferences must be discussed when considering the timing of doses especially for chronic therapy
The appropriate timing of administration should maximise therapeutic effects and minimise adverse reactions If possible doses should fit with the patient’s daily routines
Check if drug absorption is affected by meals Food may increase or decrease absorption and may also improve gastric tolerance
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are usually taken with food For patients with acute pain administration without food may be acceptable
The best time to take antihypertensive drugs is uncertain Chronotherapy studies may clarify any influence of evening or morning doses on clinical outcomes
The assessment of self-harm in adolescence should include identifying medical complications and any underlying psychiatric conditions
Changes in the frequency type and severity of self-harm can signify increasing suicidality and progression towards lethal action As 30% of adolescent self-harm involves an overdose of prescription drugs prescribing limited quantities and having the parents hold the supply can decrease this risk
Individual psychological therapies are first line They can be combined with school and parental involvement
There is very little evidence supporting the use of psychotropic drugs for treating adolescent self-harm
Older people might be embarrassed to talk about falling as they worry this may be judged as a loss of their ability to live independently Ask older patients at least yearly if they ever feel unsteady on their feet or if they have fallen
Consider whether medicines may be contributing to feelings of unsteadiness or falling Drugs such as benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors particularly if taken together are associated with a risk of falling and hip fracture
Review the patient’s treatment regimen to see if there are drugs that are no longer required Psychotropic drugs should usually be tapered gradually so that adverse effects can be minimised
Involve a range of health professionals to identify and manage the risk of falls Help patients stay physically active independent and socially connected
Pregnancy presents challenges for women with autoimmune diseases It is associated with significant physiological hormonal and immunomodulatory changes which are complex and vary according to the stage of pregnancy
Pregnancy planning and counselling should be offered
Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis tend to improve in pregnancy while systemic lupus erythematosus may increase in activity
During pregnancy the chosen regimen should control or prevent underlying disease activity and minimise risk to the fetus Ideally women should be on a stable regimen before conception
Poorly controlled disease is associated with poor outcomes for both mother and fetus such as higher risks of pre-eclampsia early delivery and growth restriction of the fetus
Postpartum there is a sudden fall in hormone concentrations and a switch to a pro-inflammatory state This increases the risk of relapse of many autoimmune diseases in particular rheumatoid arthritis Crohn’s disease and autoimmune hepatitis
Many drugs are compatible with breastfeeding but there are limited data on many of the new drugs

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THERAPEUTIC EQUIVALENCE
AIM OF PRESENTATION
In general specialist advice should be sought when stopping or switching antipsychotics
While antipsychotics are often needed long term there are circumstances when clinicians patients and families should reconsider the benefits versus the harms of continuing treatment
Withdrawal syndromes relapse and rebound can occur if antipsychotics are discontinued especially if they are stopped abruptly Generally they should be reduced and stopped slowly ideally over weeks to months
Relapse of psychosis and exacerbation occur in most patients with psychotic disorders occasionally with drastic consequences Sometimes this occurs many months after stopping antipsychotics
Switching from one antipsychotic to another is frequently indicated due to an inadequate treatment response or unacceptable adverse effects It should be carried out cautiously and under close observation
Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic drug but can have serious adverse effects particularly in older patients If possible it should not be used purely for controlling the heart rate
If a prescription for amiodarone is contemplated particularly for an older patient consult a cardiologist Avoid amiodarone in patients with significant conduction system disease significant liver or pulmonary disease or hyperthyroidism
Regular monitoring of the patient clinically and biochemically is required to identify complications at an early treatable stage Maintain a high level of suspicion if a patient taking amiodarone is experiencing adverse reactions and presents with new symptoms
Consider potential drug interactions when other drugs are prescribed with amiodarone The effects and toxicities of amiodarone may persist weeks after it is stopped

Questionnaires
Complex benign esophageal strictures are defined by length (≥2 cm), small diameter, and stricture angulation or tortuosity. The long-term course of complex esophageal strictures based on length is currently unclear. We suspect that the esophageal stricture length might impact the effectiveness of endoscopic dilation therapy. We performed a retrospective study of all benign esophageal strictures of 2 cm or longer treated at a single center between July 1, 2010, and May 31, 2014. Primary outcomes were changed in dysphagia score at the end of follow-up compared to first dilation at our facility and the need for gastrostomy placement or esophagectomy during follow-up. Data were stratified into four subgroups according to stricture length 20–29, 30–49, 50–99, and 100 mm or longer. Eighty-seven patients (mean age 66 years, 54% women) were followed over a median of 40 months. Patients underwent a median of 6 dilations, averaging 0.3 dilations per month. Median dysphagia score remained unchanged at 2; 37 (43%) patients reported resolution or improved dysphagia and 50 (57%) patients reported no improvement or worsened dysphagia. Gastrostomy placement or esophagectomy was needed for 23 (26%) and 3 (3%) patients, respectively. Median degree of dysphagia at the end of follow-up did not differ between the four stricture length subgroups, yet no patient had improvement in the 100 mm or longer subgroup. More than half of patients with long benign esophageal strictures had unchanged dysphagia or developed worse dysphagia during follow-up. Long-term outcomes did not differ between different stricture lengths

UNDERPINNING ISSUES
Anticoagulation is indicated in most cases of venous thromboembolism
Monotherapy with rivaroxaban or apixaban is the preferred option for most adults with acute venous thromboembolism
There are no recommended dose reductions for rivaroxaban or apixaban in venous thromboembolism unlike for atrial fibrillation
The initial duration of anticoagulation is usually three months
Extended treatment with low-dose rivaroxaban or apixaban is effective in preventing recurrence in patients with a continuing increased risk of thromboembolism Both drugs have low rates of major bleeding
Invasive meningococcal disease is a rare but serious infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis
Serogroup B was the predominant serogroup causing invasive meningococcal disease in Australia until 2015 Serogroup W disease has increased substantially since 2014 and in 2017 serogroups B and W caused similar numbers of invasive disease cases
Vaccines against serogroups A C W Y and B are available for anyone who wishes to reduce the risk of meningococcal disease
Vaccination is strongly recommended for people in high-risk age or population groups These are children under 2 years 15–19 year olds Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and people with medical occupational behavioural or travel-related risk factors for invasive meningococcal disease
Meningococcal ACWY vaccine is funded under the National Immunisation Program for babies aged 12 months Since April 2019 it has been funded for year 10 students through a school program There are additional state and territory-based programs for both meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B vaccines
